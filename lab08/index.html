Hi Everyone! My name is Diya Jethi and I am senior at Syracuse University. Raised in Dubai, built-in India, and based in Syracuse. I am a senior fueled by her passion for people and finance. 
Currently, majoring in Finance with a minor in Psychology and Information Management & Technology. I decided to minor in Psychology because I have always been  curious to understand the way we behave and think. 
This summer interned at Bank of America as a Financial Advisor to explore my major of Finance and find my true calling in life.
