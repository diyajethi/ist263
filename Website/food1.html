          <p> Location: Multiple restaurants in Midtown, SoHo, NoMad </p>
          <p>  Specialty: Italian</p>
           <p> My favorite dish: Spicy Vodka Pasta with Burrata</p>
            
           <p> The simplest yet most delicious meal you can get - Pasta! But what is so special about Pecora Bianca that their food is all over everyone’s Instagram story! If you are looking for a chic, stylish and trendy restaurant to visit in the city, this is your place to come to! </p>
            
           <p> My friend and I ordered, their spicy vodka pasta with burrata ( which is an additional 7 dollars) and tailgate Bolognese. All the pastas are fresh and made at the restaurant daily. As an individual who does not eat gluten, gluten free pasta is also available and it was simply delicious.
            
             It’s their Burrata Pasta (the picture above). With a spicy vodka sauce and soft burrata melting in your mouth as it adds the cheesiness to the tomato's sauciness.

         <strong> <p> Location: Multiple restaurants in SoHo, NoMad </p></strong>
         <strong> <p>  Specialty: Italian</p></strong>
         <strong> <p> My favorite dish: Signature Chocolate Tart</p></strong>
        <p> Bestia hands down has the best pizza I have ever had in my life! All their pizzas have a soft buttery crust
            leaving you looking for more pziza even when you are stuffed. They have delicious margerita, chicken pesto
        and mushroom truffle pizza! I definelty recommened their mushroom truffle pizza, I mean who doesnt love truffle!</p>
        <p> But after all that delicious pizza, we need to end the night with a chocolate haven! Bestia's choclate tart
            is the definition of a chocolate haven that you do not want to come out of! Smoothy, creamy and undeniably 
            tasty, I literally had a dream about it the other night.
        </p>
        <p> Also, if you are looking for a restaurant with amazing music, a nice ambience and a place to have wholesome
            dinner with your friends, this is the place to come! They have an indoor and outdoor seating and has 
            always been known as one of the " blockbuster" restaurants.
